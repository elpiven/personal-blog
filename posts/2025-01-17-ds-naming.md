During the development of a large Design System, I encountered a challenge: how to name components and their properties in a way that ensures consistency and ease of comprehension for multiple designers, both those creating and those using the Design System.

What I‚Äôm sharing here is the final approach I arrived at after research, experimenting with different methods and making adjustments with my team.



This approach works well for me, my team, and the Design System in my company. However, it may or may not work for you, depending on your specific needs and requirements. 


## **General Naming Rules**
Use Capital Case letters and spaces for Component names: 
***Capital Case Name***. E.g.:
 - `Button`
 - `Text Area`
 - `Icon Button`
   
Same for a component property name. E.g.:
 - `Leading Icon`
 - `Button Text`
 - `Group Title Text`

For components that serve solely as building blocks for other components and are never used on their own, use a differentiator - a **‚Äú_‚Äù** (underscore) preceding the lowercase name, and use a **‚Äú-‚Äù** (dash) instead of spaces:
**_lowercase-name**
  - `_checkbox` - serving for Checkbox Group
  - `_table-cell` - serving for Table

### **Exclusions:**
- prepositons such as  **of, in**, etc., do not require capitalization.
  - `Number of Avatars`
    
- **is** for boolean states, such as:
  - `is Interactive`
  - `is Selected`
    
- **has** for properties indicating possession, such as:
  - `has Error`
  - `has Icon`
  - `has Date of Birth`

### **Punctuation Rules**

- In **Components** names: do not use punctuation marks, except for **space** and the **‚Äú-‚Äù** (dash)
- In **Properties** names: do not use punctuation marks, except for **space**, "**:**" (colon) and the "**‚Äî**" (em dash) (both used for Groups)

## **Property Order**

Start with the **Size** property, followed by **Type**(e.g.,Primary, Secondary etc), **Status** (e.g., On/Off, Empty/Filled), **Style** (related to appeariance) and close the main group with **State** (e.g., Disabled, Hovered etc).
It can also include some defferentiators such as: 
  - `is Inteactive`
  - `is Selected`
  - `Is Typable`

Then include everything else that is less important, focusing more on the component‚Äôs parts rather than the whole. For example:
  - `has Icon`
  - `Icon`
  - `Button Text`
  

## **Appropriate property usage**

### **Type / Style**

- Use **Type** property for main differentiators (e.g., `Primary`, `Parent`, `Business Partner`).
- Use **Style** for all secondary, stylistic properties (e.g., `Outline`, `Success`, `Red`, `Beta`, `Indeterminate`, `Top Arrow`, `Horizontal`).

### **Status**

- Use **Status** for binary states, such as `Off/On` or `Empty/Filled`.

### **State**

- Use **State** for user interactions, such as:
  - `Enabled`
  - `Hovered`
  - `Pressed`
  - `Focused`
  - `Visited`
  - `Disabled`
  - `Read-Only`

- Use ‚úÖ **is Selected** property instead of üö´`State: Selected` for the selected state of a component. This is because a component can be simultaneously selected and focused.

  
- If there are **Selected**, **Not Selected**, and **Indeterminate** states, use ‚úÖ **Style** property to differentiate them.

## **Property Naming**
### **Error State**

- Use name:  ‚úÖ **has Error** instead of üö´ **is Errored** for error-related properties.

### **Directional Terminology**

- Use  ‚úÖ **Leading** / **Trailing** instead of üö´"Left" / "Right."

### **Text Property**

- Use the format: **{Element Name} Text** for naming text layers.
  - `Label Text`

### **Group**

- For containing groups use "**‚Äî**" (em dash): **‚Äîhas Group: {Group Name}**
  - `‚Äîhas Group: Leading Box `


## **Property values**
1. Mark the **default** value explicitly, for example: 
  - `Primary (Default)`
  - `Enabled (Default)`
    
2. For **Size:** use clothing size system:
`xxs, xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl`

4. For **Boolean properties** use:
- ‚úÖ **True** and **False** instead of           
- üö´ **Yes** and **No**
